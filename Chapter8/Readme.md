#Objects and Classes

After you finish this chapter, you'll have enough knowledge to be considered proficient in Java. Don't get me wrong, there's still plenty of value in this book, but, with an understanding of objects and classes, you'll be ready to develop real programs.

The above statement is a bit of a stretch, but the point is to get you to devour this chapter and to realize that you can do practically anything with Java. You can program anything, it's just a matter of breaking problems down and then writing code. You might be thinking, "Well, how am I going to make <insert ambitious project here> if all I'm doing is writing loops that print out patterns and solve trivial math problems?"

What you've learned so far is only the tip of the iceberg, and it only gets better from here. While most would agree that it's not a good idea to stop reading after chapter 8, you're well on your way, and it only gets more fun from here on out.
